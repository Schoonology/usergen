# UserGen

This is a simple module that generates user data. Originally intended for
testing purposes, some of the methods could be useful outside of testing, such
as username generation.

## Installation

```sh
npm install usergen --save-dev
```

## Usage Example

```js
```

## Alternatives

 - [randomuser.me](http://randomuser.me/) - A fantastic service with the same
 purpose. The only reason this module exists is because I wanted the same
 simple, useful feature offline. I also didn't need some of the features, like
 the profile picture. If you're looking for more fields and don't need to run
 your tests offline, _use this service_.
